# Getting Started with Botmaster on BlueMix

If you wish to simply deploy a Botmaster instance without having to edit any of the pre existing code or do not wish to connect any additional API or additional functionality, use the steps below.

1. In order to setup botmatser and a webhook for messenger to link to your Watson conversation we first need to deploy a BlueMix application. So go ahead and hit the button.
<div align="center">

2. Log into BlueMix
3. Give you application a unique name (this will be the URL for the base of your webhook e.g wwww.helloworld.mybluemix.net/webhook)
4. Select the space and organisation to deploy to.
![Name your application] (https://github.com/ReeceMed/Botmaster-FBMessenger-WatsonConversation/blob/master/readmeimages/bluemixname.png?raw=true)
5. Once complete you will be presented with this screen, now you can click edit code if you wish to add additional functionality.

# Getting started with Botmaster Locally

The best way to begin to utilise Botmaster is to run the app locally. This will allow you to customise the code if you so wish. If however you are happy with what is already included go ahead and skip to Getting Started with Botmaster on BlueMix.

Begin by changing to the directory of this repository you have just cloned or downloaded.
	
* This can be done via command line e.g `cd Desktop/Botmaster-FBMessenger-Watson `

To customise your Botmaster framework, such as adding additional actions or API services find documentation here [Botmaster Documentation] (https://Botmasterai.github.io/) 

As described in the botmaster docs on [webhooks](http://botmasterai.com/getting-started/webhooks/) You can use the command `npm run tunnel`. Make sure to edit the subdomain with something appropiate for your app.

Otherwise lets get going!

>>>>>>> Stashed changes
![Environment Variables] (https://github.com/ReeceMed/Botmaster-FBMessenger-WatsonConversation/blob/master/readmeimages/env.png?raw=true)


##Logging into BlueMix
BlueMix is where we will host our application, therefore we will make use of the cloud foundry to help us manage and push the application. 

1. Open terminal or command prompt
2. Set the API endpoint of your BlueMix space
	* `cf api https://api.ng.bluemix.net` - US South
	* `cf api https://api.eu-gb.bluemix.net` - UK
3. Login to BlueMix using:
	* `cf login`
	* Enter your email address of your BlueMix account
	* Hit enter
	* Enter your password of your BlueMix Account (*it will appear your password is not typing*)
	* Hit enter
4. Select your space following on screen prompt
5. To confirm and check which region, org and space is currently targeted type:
	* `cf target`

Once you have successfully logged in and targetted BlueMix you can now push your application to BlueMix.

##Pushing to BlueMix
Once you have finished working on your application you can now push this to BlueMix to be hosted. Using the steps above login to BlueMix.

1. Open terminal or command prompt
2. Login to BlueMix
2. Change directory to your repository using `cd yourrepository`
3. Use the following command to push to BlueMix `cf push`
	* Note: Before you use cf push ensure you have edited the manifest.yml file. You will need to update lines **6** and **7** using the unique name of your application

#Exporting Your Conversation
